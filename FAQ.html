                            You can  download firware, and reprogramming your keyboard <span style="text-decoration: underline;">easily</span>

							<br>
							<h3>Can I change my order afterwards?</h3>
							<br>
							Yes, reply to your order confirmation.
							<br>
							<h3>What is a pre-order?</h3>
							<br>
							In a pre-order, you order the item you want, pay for it and we will produce it and ship it at an estimated date later. 
							<br>
							<h3>Can I get some items immediately?</h3>
							<br>
							Yes, read the product description to find out if the product is "in stock", then it will ship as fast as possible,<br>
							often within 1-3 days, unless something else is specified.
							<br>
							<h3>Why isn't everything available?</h3>	
							<br>
							We can not keep up with the demand, therefore, the products are usually available in pre-orders
							<br>
							<h3>Why hasn't my order shipped yet?</h3>
							<br>
							These are low quantity keyboard parts, often with multiple color options. It takes time to produce and ship, contact support <br>
							about it after the estimated time of shipment has happened, so we can check that your order is en route. At Mekanisk we aim to <br>
							hold all estimates. 
							<br>
							<h3>Taxes?</h3>
							<br>
							Taxes, custom charges, courier extra charges etc is always the customers responsibility. The orders are shipping from China,<br>
							and it is the customers responsibility to check their local regulations.<br>
							Swedish orders will ship from Sweden, and there are no extra charges. VAT is included in the price for Swedish customers.
							<br>
							<h1>Terms</h1>
							<h3>Delivery</h3>
							<br>
							Pre order items are made to order, and therefore only have an estimated delivery date. Production and fulfillment delays may <br>
							occur, and will extend the estimated delivery time. In stock items have a per item estimate on the product page. 
							<br>
							<h3>Cancellations</h3>
							<br>
							Since all the pre order products are made to order, there are fundamentally no order cancellations per EU regulations.
							<br>
							<h3>Quality Control Guarantee</h3>
							<br>
							All the parts have a strict quality control, both material wise and with the surface finish. Some of our designs are particularly<br>
							difficult to make, and some flaws might occur on a very small percentage of production units. If these manage to slip through<br>
							quality control, we need to know so we can get better. Contact support with pictures, current address and order number and we<br>
							will compensate you. Color might look different from render pictures, and earlier products due to the anodizing process. 
							<br>
							<br>
							<br>
							<b>By purchasing a pre order item or in stock item you all accept these terms.</b>
							<br>
							<br>
							<br>
